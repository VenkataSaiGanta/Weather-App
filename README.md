## Overview

This project is a simple weather application built with ReactJS. It fetches weather data from the Meteosource Weather API and displays it in a user-friendly interface. This project aims to demonstrate how to integrate third-party APIs with React and how to build a complete application from scratch.

## Features

- Fetch and display current weather data for any location
- User-friendly interface with styled-components
- Responsive design
- Error handling for API requests

### Usage

1. Start the development server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following dependencies:

- **axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the Meteosource Weather API. It simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **bootstrap-icons**: A library of free, high-quality icons designed for Bootstrap, but usable in any project. These icons enhance the visual appeal and user experience of the app.
